# TensorFlow Lite PoseNet Android Demo

This is an app that continuously detects the body parts in the frames seen by device's camera.

## Build the demo using Android Studio

### Prerequisites
* Android device and Android development environment with minimum API 21.

### Building
* From the `Open File or Project` window that appears, navigate to and select the `tensorflow-lite/examples/posenet/android` directory from wherever you cloned the TensorFlow Lite sample GitHub repo. Click `OK`.

* If it asks you to do a `Gradle Sync`, click `OK`.

* You may also need to install various platforms and tools, if you get errors
 like `Failed to find target with hash string 'android-21'` and similar. Click
 the `Run` button or select `Run` > `Run 'android'` from the
 top menu. You may need to rebuild the project using `Build` > `Rebuild Project`.

* If it asks you to use `Instant Run`, click `Proceed Without Instant Run`.

* Also, you need to have an Android device plugged in with developer options
 enabled at this point. See **[here](
 https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device)** for more details
 on setting up developer devices.
